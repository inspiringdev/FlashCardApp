# FlashCardApp
Developed a Flashcard Learning App using Visual C++ and WinForms as part of my 2nd semester OOP project. Features include creating, deleting, and shuffling flashcards, managing separate decks, and a self-test mode. A simple yet complete desktop tool to practice OOP and UI design fundamentals.
