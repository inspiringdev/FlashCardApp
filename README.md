# FlashCardApp
## 📚 Flashcard App – OOP Semester Project
A simple and modular Flashcard Learning Application built using Visual C++ (WinForms) under the .NET Framework. Developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) coursework during the second semester at NUST.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Language: Visual C++

GUI Framework: WinForms

Platform: .NET Framework (Windows)

## 🚀 Features
✅ Create Flashcards: Add new question-answer pairs through a simple form interface.

🔄 Shuffle Cards: Randomize order of flashcards to test memory recall.

➕ Add/Delete Functionality: Modify decks dynamically without restarting the app.

📁 Separate Decks Support: Organize flashcards under different topics/categories.

▶️ Card Navigation: Flip through flashcards interactively with next/back buttons.

🧠 Self-Test Mode: Try recalling answers before flipping to test your memory.

## 🧩 Concepts Used
Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Classes, Constructors)

Event-driven programming in WinForms

Modular structure with Deck & Card classes

Basic file handling (if applicable)

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
This project helped reinforce:

Practical application of OOP principles in a UI-based program

Use of WinForms for building interactive desktop apps

Structuring a user-friendly and responsive system from scratch

Managing object lists and collections dynamically

## 📦 Installation & Run Instructions
Open the solution in Visual Studio

Build the project using the .sln file

Run the application — no additional configuration needed

## 📌 Future Improvements
Export/import flashcards from files

Search functionality within decks

Flashcard difficulty levels or learning streaks

Timed quiz mode for better testing
